C-Name: SuperPicInit
Prototype: GUGGD1,L,DG
Help: superellpicinit(f,m,p,a,{e=1},{P}): Initiatilises the Jacobian of the superellptic curve y^m=f(x) over Zq/p^e, where Zq is the ring of integers of the unramified extension of Qp of degree a. p must be a prime of good reduction of the curve, and m must be coprime with the degree of f. P, if present, should be an affine point on the curve; it is required to construct maps from the Jacobian to A1.
