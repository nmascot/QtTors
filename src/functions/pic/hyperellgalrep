Prototype: GGGLGDGD0,U,
Help: hyperellgalrep(f,l,p,e,P,{Chi},{a}): Computes p-adically the Galois representation afforded by the l-torsion of the hyperelliptic curve C:y²=f(x), or C:y²+h(x)*y=f(x) if f is a vector [f,h]. p must be an odd prime of good reduction of this model. P must be a pair of points on C which are defined over the same field and not conjugate by the hyperelliptic involution. e is a guess for the required p-adic accuracy. If present, Chi must divide mod l hyperellcharpoly(Mod(f,p)) mod l, and be coprime with is cofactor; in this case, we compute the Galois representation attached to the subspace of the l-torsion where Frob_p acts with characteristic polynomial Chi. If a is present, work in the unramified extension of Qp of degree a; else a is chosen automatically.
