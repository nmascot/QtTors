Function: picistorsionval
Section: modular_forms
C-Name: PicIsTors_val
Prototype: uGGG
Help: picistorsionval(J,W,F): Given a point W on the p-adic Jacobian J of p-adic precision e and a polynomial F in Z[x], returns the largest e' <= e such that F(Frob_p).W agrees mod p^e' with the origin of J. F is also allowed to be an integer.
