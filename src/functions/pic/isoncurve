C-Name: PtIsOnPlaneCurve
Prototype: lGG
Help: isoncurve(F,P): true(1) if P is on the plane curve of equation F=0, false(0) if not. F can be a polynomial in two variables, or a homogenous polynomial in three variables. TODO In the former case, P must be of the form [x,y], in the latter, P can be of the form [x,y] or [x,y,z].
